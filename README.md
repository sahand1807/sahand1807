### About Me
I'm a mechanical engineer (PhD) passionate about understanding and controlling dynamic systems — from classical mechanics to intelligent robots.  
I enjoy bridging **physics, control theory, machine learning, and reinforcement learning** to design systems that can learn and adapt in the real world.

- Building learning-based control systems for robotic and dynamic environments  
- Exploring reinforcement learning, MPC, and optimal control for real-world tasks  
- Interested in combining **simulation + real-world robotics** for adaptive behavior  
- Skilled in **Python**, **MATLAB**, and **C++** for modeling, analysis, and control

### Technical Interests
- Classical & Nonlinear Dynamics  
- Model Predictive Control (MPC)  
- Reinforcement Learning (RL)  
- System Identification & Modeling  
- Robotics Perception & Simulation  
- Multi-body Dynamics
